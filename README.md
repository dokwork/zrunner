# ZRunner

![zig version](https://img.shields.io/badge/zig%20version-0.15.1-fcca77)

A simple test runner for zig with detailed report, and support of selective running tests in modules.

![demo](assets/demo.png)

## Motivation
The default zig test runner doesn't show a full list of all run tests. As a result, the report output 
is very compact, but it doesnâ€™t indicate when some test was unexpectedly not run. The main reason why 
it could happened, the semantic analyzer doesn't see some of your dependencies (see for more details 
[refAllDecls](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.testing.refAllDecls) and 
[refAllDeclsRecursive](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.testing.refAllDeclsRecursive)).
So, the main purpose of ZRunner is showing complete test report that
mentions passed tests too.

## Features

  - Showing all tests, or failed only;
  - Customizable colorful output;
  - Flexible filters of the tests to run;
  - TODO: run tests in parallel.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this runner is copy-past `zrunner.zig` file to your
own project.

### Configuration in `build.zig`

When the `zrunner.zig` is copied to your project (assuming to the root directory) you should initialize
a new runner in your `build.zig`:

```zig
const test_runner = std.Build.Step.Compile.TestRunner{
    .path = b.path("zrunner.zig"),
    .mode = .simple,
};
```

Now you may use it in your tests:
```zig
const tests_module = b.addTest(.{
    .name = "MyTestModule",     // this helps to filter tests
    .root_module = module,
    .test_runner = test_runner, // use zrunner
});
const run_module_tests = b.addRunArtifact(tests_module);
```
It's better to setup a name for your `tests_module` explicitly. By default, all test
modules have a name "test". In multi-module project an explicit name helps to run tests
only from particular modules.

ZRunner uses [std.Io.tty](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.1/std/#std.Io.tty)
to generate a colorfull output. It may be reasonable to set up an environment variable
"CLICOLOR_FORCE" to force coloring output in some cases:
```zig
run_module_tests.setEnvironmentVariable("CLICOLOR_FORCE", "true");
```
See [std.Io.tty.Config.detect](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.1/std/#std.Io.tty.Config.detect)
for more details.

You can find complete example of configuration here: [build.zig](build.zig).

## Options

ZRunner supports a few run options to manage tests to run, and report output. Use
`--` to pass them to the runner (assuming your step to run tests has name "test"):
```sh
zig build test -- <put options here>
```
  * **-m &lt;str>, --modules-only=&lt;str>** Run only tests from modules whose names contain a given substring <str>.<br/> 
  Zig executes each test module as a separate console application. You can provide a substring to
  choose modules to run. For example, if you have two test modules,
  `tests_module_a` and `tests_module_b`, running: `zig build test -- --modules-only=a` will run only tests from the
  module `tests_module_a`.

  * **-t &lt;str>, --tests-only=&lt;str>** Run only tests whose names contain a given substring <str>.<br/>
  Similar to `--modules-only`, but filters tests across all modules by their original names, as defined in
  [`std.builtin.TestFn`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.1/std/#std.builtin.TestFn).

  * **--failed-only** Include in the report only failed tests.<br/>
  All test will be run, but only failed will be included to the report.

  * **--no-stack-trace** Do not print a stack trace of failed tests.<br/>
  By default, zrunner includes stack traces of failed tests in the report, but omits the first entries, 
  which typically point to lines in `std.testing.*` files. This option exclude
  stactk traces from the report at all.

  * **--colors=<zon>** Parse a &lt;zon> string as a `FileReporter.Colors` and use it in test report.
  See [colors](#colors) section for more details.

  * **--no-colors** Do not use ascii escape codes to make an output colorful. Ignore the '--colors' option.

  * **--stdout** Print output to the stdout. Default.

  * **--stderr** Print output to the stderr.

  * **--file=<file path>** Create and open a file <file path> to append a test report to it.

_You can try every provided option running tests from this [example](example/)._

## Colors

ZRunner uses [`std.Io.tty.Color`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.15.1/std/#std.Io.tty.Color) 
to highlight a test report output. The follow
highlight groups are used: 
  - `title`, 
  - `process_name`, 
  - `no_tests`,
  - `namespace`,
  - `test_name`,
  - `filter`,
  - `summary`,
  - `passed`,
  - `failed`,
  - `skipped`,
  - `memory_leak`.

You can override them by passing an option `--colors=<zon>`,where &lt;zon> is a
representation of the [Colors](zrunner.FileReporter.Colors) structure. For
example, let's change a couple of default colors to make highlight groups more
obvious:
```zig
zig build test -- --no-stack-trace --tests-only=test --colors=".{.title=.green, .namespace=.blue}" 2> /dev/null
```
